				"This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence (Data) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the Technology skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a datapad, an arcane terminal, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an interface rig is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence (Data) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device.",
				"Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called Hacking and requires the use of an {@item interface rig|darkmatter}, as well as an Intelligence (Data) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's datapad to give you access to their information or bank account."

You don't need proficiency in Piloting to fly a ship (be it an aircraft or a spacecraft), but proficiency in this skill can help when you need to make a crash landing or pull off a risky maneuver in a dogfight. The GM might call for a Dexterity (Piloting) check when you attempt to fly a ship through an electromagnetic storm that disrupts the controls, or when you wish to perform a hard stop or pull a high-G turn."

				"Your Intelligence (Technology) check measures your ability to understand the inner workings of technological devices. Most devices are powered by some form of magic, but plenty of intricate design goes into channeling that magic into useful effects.

The GM may call for an Intelligence (Technology) check when you attempt to modify a blaster, repair your ship's {@item shield generator|darkmatter}, disable a rogue android, or sabotage an arcane terminal."

									"Lizards really, but legends grow. I am not sure, truth be told, what to believe or not believe when it comes to dwarven lap dragons. Some dwarven legends hold that millenia ago, dwarves somehow managed to 'domesticate' true dragons. How this was done is never truly explained by these fanciful tales, but suffice it to say it supposedly involved the stealing of many dragon eggs, proper incubation, followed by intense training, magical shrinkage and selective breeding. Other, more sober dwarves will tell you that lap-dragons are merely a kind of underground lizard, as related to true dragons, as mice are to eagles. Regardless of their unknown origins, lap-dragons can often be found in the homes of affluent dwarves.They are aptly named, as they view a dwarven lap, as a true dragon might view its lair; solid, comforting, and warm. In appearance, well, to these untrained eyes, they look like rat-sized lizards, yet these creatures have several unique abilities as well, perhaps lending some credence to their legends. Lap-Dragons can breathe forth noxious fumes, that dwarves seem immune to, yet I found unbearable. Let me also not neglect to mention that they are highly intelligent and mischievous, when not entombed in their master's laps having their emerald-green scales scratched. They also possess a peculiar capacity for judging character and intent! Often a dwarf will either welcome or send away a guest, depending on the hisses and scratchings of their lap-dragons, when brought in front of the individual. I would have to spend many more years, to truly explain the ecology of these reptiles, but know that they exist! I would welcome any naturalist's opinions on the matter."

											"An allip might attempt to share its lore to escape its curse and enter the afterlife. It can transfer knowledge from its mind by guiding another creature to write down what it knows. This process takes days or possibly weeks. An allip can accomplish this task by lurking in the study or workplace of a scholar. If the allip remains hidden, its victim is gradually overcome by manic energy. A scholar, driven by sudden insights to work night and day, produces reams of text with little memory of exactly what the documents contain. If the allip succeeds, it passes from the world—and its terrible secret hides somewhere in the scholar's text, waiting to be discovered by its next victim."

Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.",
