A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree."

When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the murderer.
