If the crawling claw's creator doesn't command it, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability.",
											"Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree."

The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw's torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life."

When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the murderer.
