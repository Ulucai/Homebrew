A catoblepas might be found with the one mate it chooses for life and, on occasion, a calf. Especially if it's guarding its young, a catoblepas attacks anyone that moves too close.",

Whatever the origin of the creature, stories link the catoblepas to misfortune, and many of these yarns have elements of truth. Some such tales claim that hags tend catoblepases like cattle, and that a swamp that contains a catoblepas might also be home to a hag that drinks the monster's milk. Although a particular catoblepas might not be linked to a hag, a coven of hags might keep one or more of these beasts as guardians or pets. Other legends say that those of impure heart can tame a catoblepas. Indeed, some tales have circulated of malevolent warlocks and dark knights who have discovered how to domesticate the beasts and use them as mounts."

Swamp gases have a hint of the catoblepas's foulness to them. Animals in the area are more aggressive and liable to be diseased.

									"Lizards really, but legends grow. I am not sure, truth be told, what to believe or not believe when it comes to dwarven lap dragons. Some dwarven legends hold that millenia ago, dwarves somehow managed to 'domesticate' true dragons. How this was done is never truly explained by these fanciful tales, but suffice it to say it supposedly involved the stealing of many dragon eggs, proper incubation, followed by intense training, magical shrinkage and selective breeding. Other, more sober dwarves will tell you that lap-dragons are merely a kind of underground lizard, as related to true dragons, as mice are to eagles. Regardless of their unknown origins, lap-dragons can often be found in the homes of affluent dwarves.They are aptly named, as they view a dwarven lap, as a true dragon might view its lair; solid, comforting, and warm. In appearance, well, to these untrained eyes, they look like rat-sized lizards, yet these creatures have several unique abilities as well, perhaps lending some credence to their legends. Lap-Dragons can breathe forth noxious fumes, that dwarves seem immune to, yet I found unbearable. Let me also not neglect to mention that they are highly intelligent and mischievous, when not entombed in their master's laps having their emerald-green scales scratched. They also possess a peculiar capacity for judging character and intent! Often a dwarf will either welcome or send away a guest, depending on the hisses and scratchings of their lap-dragons, when brought in front of the individual. I would have to spend many more years, to truly explain the ecology of these reptiles, but know that they exist! I would welcome any naturalist's opinions on the matter."
